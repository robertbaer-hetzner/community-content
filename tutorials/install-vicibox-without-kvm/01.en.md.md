## Introduction  
  
This tutorial covers the installation of a Vicibox operating system on dedicated hardware without using a KVM console.

The following versions were evaluated: 
 * ViciBox_v10 (10.0.1)
  
**Prerequisites**  
  
* dedicated root server within the rescue system
* VNC Viewer on the Client
* a Vicibox ISO
  
## Step 1 - `Pepering the rescue system`  
  
First we have to make sure that the tool [Quemu](https://linux.die.net/man/1/qemu-kvm) is installed. Normally this should be the case. But to make sure it was not removed in future rescue versions, we use the following command: 
```console
root@rescue ~ # apt update && apt install qemu-kvm
```
Next the desired ISO needs to be uploaded to the server. There are several options to accomplish this:

*   Upload via sFTP
*   Mount an SMB / NFS storage ([Storage Box](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/general))
*   Downloading the ISO from the [official website](http://www.vicibox.com/server/index.html)
	* http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v10.x86_64-10.0.1.iso

We are closing this step with partitioning the desired drive. For this we are using the tool [parted](https://linux.die.net/man/8/parted). Keep in mind that this will erase the current data on the selected drive.

First select the drive, where the operating system should be installed on:
```console
root@rescue ~ # parted /dev/sda
```

?---

Create the partition table for drives smaller than 2 TB:

```console
mklabel msdos
```

Create the partition table for drives larger than 2 TB:

```console
mklabel gpt
```
?---



## Step 2 - `Log into the server trough an SSH Tunnel`  
  
We will need this, as we want to use VNC to get a visual output while installing the operating system.
If we skip this, then the VM is accessible for the whole world. As we would like to prevent this, we are using the following command:

```console
ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:5901 root@<Root_Server_IPv4>
```

This command can be used on Linux and Windows. The only prerequisite is [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)
  
### Step 3 - `Starting the virtual machine`  
  
```console
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -smp 4 -m 4096 -boot d -cdrom <Path_to_ISO> -drive file=/dev/sda,format=raw,media=disk -vnc 127.0.0.1:1
```

|Parameter|Description|
|--|--|
| smp | Number of CPU cores |
| m |  Size of the used RAM|
| cdrom |  Path to ISO image|
| drive |  hard disk on which the system is to be installed|
| vnc |  VNC Server Settings|

Now as the VM is starting, we can connect to a VNC viewer of your choice at the following address:

```console
127.0.0.1:8888
```  

### Step 4 - `Installing the system`  

Now that we have started the VM we can now proceed with the installation process. Luckily this is relatively easy, as we only need to start the boot entry `Install Vicibox_<Version>`.

**! - INSERT SCREENSHOT OF BOOTENTRIES HERE - !**

 Afterwards everything is done automatically. As soon as the system is installed please log into the operating system with the following credentials. Those are provided as a standard login. Therefore we recommend to change them immediately. Otherwise your system can easily be opened up later. Simply use the `passwd` command inside the system.

|Username|Password|
|--|--|
|root|vicidial|

When this is done you can perform a correct shutdown with the command `init 0`.
Then return to the rescue system itself.

Unfortunately while installing the system, the wrong network interface is set as default. We need to correct this first, before the server can get reachable within the operating system. 

As a first step we will need to find out where the config file is located. For this we use the command `lsblk` . 

```console
root@rescue ~ # lsblk 
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0    7:0    0   3.1G  1 loop 
sda      8:0    0 476.9G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0     2M  0 part 
├─sda2   8:2    0    20M  0 part 
├─sda3   8:3    0     4G  0 part 
└─sda4   8:4    0 472.9G  0 part 
sdb      8:16   0   3.6T  0 disk 
sdc      8:32   0   3.6T  0 disk 
```
In this case it is `sda4` . We now have to mount the partition in order to get access to the files.

```console
root@rescue ~ # mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
```

Now a simple command fixes the network issue. This sets the default interface name from "eth0" to "eth1".

```console
root@rescue ~ # mv /mnt/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0 /mnt/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1
```

When this is done we can safely reboot the server and wait until the server is reachable again. Then we can login as the root user and the changed password, which was set earlier. 





## Conclusion  
  
Now you should have a working Vicibox operating system, without requesting the KVM and a USB-drive. This method will safe you time, when you want to install multiple servers.
