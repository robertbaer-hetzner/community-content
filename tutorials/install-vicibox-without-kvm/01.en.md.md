## Introduction  
  
This tutorial covers the installation of a Vicibox operating system on dedicated hardware without using a KVM console.

The following versions were evaluated: 
 * ViciBox_v10 (10.0.1)
  
**Prerequisites**  
  
* dedicated root server within the rescue system
* VNC Viewer on the Client
* a Vicibox ISO
  
## Step 1 - `Pepering the rescue system`  
  
First we have to make sure that the tool [Quemu](https://linux.die.net/man/1/qemu-kvm) is installed. Normally this should be the case. But to make sure it was not removed in future rescue versions, we use the following command: 
```console
# apt update && apt install qemu-kvm
```
Next the desired ISO needs to be uploaded to the server. There are several options to accomplish this:

*   Upload via sFTP
*   Mount an SMB / NFS storage ([Storage Box](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/general))
*   Downloading the ISO from the [official website](http://www.vicibox.com/server/index.html)
	* http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v10.x86_64-10.0.1.iso

We are closing this step with partitioning the desired drive. For this we are using the tool [parted](https://linux.die.net/man/8/parted). Keep in mind that this will erase the current data on the selected drive.

First select the drive, where the operating system should be installed on:
```console
# parted /dev/sda
```

?---

Create the partition table for drives smaller than 2 TB:

```console
mklabel msdos
```

Create the partition table for drives larger than 2 TB:

```console
mklabel gpt
```
?---



## Step 2 - `Log into the server trough an SSH Tunnel`  
  
We will need this, as we want to use VNC to get a visual output while installing the operating system.
If we skip this, then the VM is accessible for the whole world. As we would like to prevent this, we are using the following command:

```console
ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:5901 root@<Root_Server_IPv4>
```

This command can be used on Linux and Windows. The only prerequisite is [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)
  
### Step 3 - `Starting the virtual machine`  
  
```console
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -smp 4 -m 4096 -boot d -cdrom <Path_to_ISO> -drive file=/dev/sda,format=raw,media=disk -vnc 127.0.0.1:1
```

|Parameter|Description|
|--|--|
| smp | Number of CPU cores |
| m |  Size of the used RAM|
| cdrom |  Path to ISO image|
| drive |  hard disk on which the system is to be installed|
| vnc |  VNC Server Settings|

Now as the VM is starting, we can connect to a VNC viewer of your choice at the following address:

```console
127.0.0.1:8888
```

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
