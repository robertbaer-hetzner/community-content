## Introduction  
  
This tutorial covers the installation of a Vicibox operating system on dedicated hardware without using a KVM console.

The following versions were evaluated: 
 * ViciBox_v10 (10.0.1)
  
**Prerequisites**  
  
* dedicated root server within the rescue system
* a Vicibox ISO
  
## Step 1 - `Pepering the rescue system`  
  
First we have to make sure that the tool [Quemu](https://linux.die.net/man/1/qemu-kvm) is installed. Normally this should be the case. But to make sure it was not removed in future rescue versions, we use the following command: 
```console
# apt update && apt install qemu-kvm
```
Next the desired ISO needs to be uploaded to the server. There are several options to accomplish this:

*   Upload via sFTP
*   Mount an SMB / NFS storage ([Storage Box](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/general))
*   Downloading the ISO from the [official website](http://www.vicibox.com/server/index.html)
	* http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v10.x86_64-10.0.1.iso

We are closing this step with partitioning the desired drive. For this we are using the tool [parted](https://linux.die.net/man/8/parted). Keep in mind that this will erase the current data on the selected drive.

First select the drive, where the operating system should be installed on:
```console
# parted /dev/sda
```
Create the partition table for drives smaller than 2 TB:

```console
mklabel msdos
```

Create the partition table for drives larger than 2 TB:

```console
mklabel gpt
```
